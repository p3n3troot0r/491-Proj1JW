/* The goal of this project is:
 * - to utilize Deep Learning algorithms for effective classification of blocking artifacts, 
 *    introduced as a side effect of image compression. 
 * - to utilize Deep Learning algorithms to classify objects in images and derive contextual
 *    contextual relationships.
